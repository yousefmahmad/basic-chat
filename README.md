# basic-chat
This application is a basic chat room site that uses python and django-channels as the build. I simply followed the basic tutorial to begin at:
https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html

This was created to simply improve my python skills and to learn something new in django. Next steps are to hook this up to a React front end and make it look pretty.

## Getting Started
Simply run these commands in your terminal.

First, to download the dependencies run:

`pip install`

Second, create your virutal env (make sure you have virtualenv installed):

`virtualenv env`


Lastly, start your server:

`python manage.py runserver`
